## Firefly-Trivia
Trivia game for General Assembly first project that allows us to use what we have learned in class.  Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Api and no frameworks. 

## Motivation
I love Firefly and still had a fear of api's and comparing answers with a inputbox.  I also didn't want to use any template for style, I just want to freeform it.  

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. -
