## Motivation
I love Firefly and still had a fear of api's and comparing answers with a inputbox.  I also didn't want to use any template for style, I just want to freeform it.  

## Build status
Has commented out code for an API that I eventually didn't like to use.  I'm leaving this code in for when I create my own API to connect it.
