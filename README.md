## Firefly-Trivia
Trivia game for General Assembly first project that allows us to use what we have learned in class.  Using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Api and no frameworks. 

## Motivation
I love Firefly and still had a fear of api's and comparing answers with a inputbox.  I also didn't want to use any template for style, I just want to freeform it.  

## Build status
Build status of continus integration i.e. travis, appveyor etc. Ex. - 
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/dp9KtQ2" data-context="false" ><a href="//imgur.com/a/dp9KtQ2"></a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
